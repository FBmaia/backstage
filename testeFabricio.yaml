## Terminology

Backstage is constructed out of three parts. We separate Backstage in this way
because we see three groups of contributors that work with Backstage in three
different ways.

- Core - Base functionality built by core developers in the open source project.
- App - The app is an instance of a Backstage app that is deployed and tweaked.
  The app ties together core functionality with additional plugins. The app is
  built and maintained by app developers, usually a productivity team within a
  company.
